    instructions:
      "Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness and place it on a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread a generous layer of tomato sauce evenly over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust. Evenly distribute smoked jackfruit and pineapple chunks over the tomato sauce, adding any additional toppings you like, such as sliced red onions or bell peppers. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the toppings, covering them evenly, and add a sprinkle of Parmesan or other cheese for extra flavor. Bake the pizza in a preheated oven at 475°F (245°C) for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, slice, and serve.

    instructions:
      "Start by preheating your air fryer to 400°F (200°C). Wash and scrub 2-3 large russet potatoes thoroughly, then pat them dry with a paper towel. Cut the potatoes into thick, evenly sized wedges or steak fry shapes. In a large bowl, toss the potato wedges with 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil, ensuring each piece is coated evenly. Season generously with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings like garlic powder, paprika, or dried herbs. Arrange the seasoned potato wedges in a single layer in the air fryer basket, making sure they are not overcrowded. Cook for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking, until the fries are golden brown and crispy. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce, such as ketchup or aioli. Enjoy these delicious and healthier Air Fryer Steak Fries as a tasty side dish or snack!",
